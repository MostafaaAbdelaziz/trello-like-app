## Somethings you might notice along the way.

- If you logged in before and did not log out and try to run the react application it will show you
localhost:3000 and a blank screen. Everything is working but since you did not exit the application correctly
react assumes you are already logged in. so if you run into that issue write localhost:3000/home and it should
display infront of you. The user has to make sure to log out after their session is done for it to function correctly.

- The deliverable 3 will be found in a branch called Release 3 where the latest submission will be found accordingly
with this exact readme file.

- As per long discussions with Professor, Head TA, and our group TA we were given 5 marks to be removed and distributed into other tasks. so we 
came to a final decisiont that we want to drop exactly:

- API to assign a member to a task which is worth exactly 2 marks
- Filter based on date, api and filter option which is 2 and 1 marks so 
we will be dropping both of them hence achieving all the 5 marks that we
should be dropping

Everything else was implemented and should work including boards, workspace and tasks and more things you will see along the way.
